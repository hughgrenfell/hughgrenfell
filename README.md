Hi,

I have been writing snippets of code for most of my adult life for work and personal projects. I took some programming in university, but a lot has changed since then. In March of 2020
I decided to carry on where I left off, and signed up for a software development program using Java. I really wanted to take my understanding of programming to the next level, including getting deeper into
OOP. I have since started expanding into additional languages and some web programming and am loving it.

These days, I work primarily with JavaScript, and React, but have been experimenting lately with NextJS, NextAuth, Prisma, and Tailwind.

My website is really a space to experiment with new tools and practice new techniques. It is rarely in any kind of polished shape and has been redeveloped and redeployed countless times. 

- I'm particularly interested in development of finance tools to make personal investing easier and more transparent. I take a value approach
to investing and want to have a better toolkit for evaluating the fundamentals, a way to reduce some of the grunt work. 
- I'm also generally interested in the idea of "automating the boring stuff" in my life. Much like anyone reading this, I'm sure, I'm more
interested in my projects than I am the monotony of daily life. I always love to hear about projects to automate some of that away.
