Hi,

I am mostly pretty new to programming, in particular OOP, but I have been writing snippets of code for most of my adult life
for work and personal projects. I took some programming in university 20 years ago, but a lot has changed since then. In March of 2020
I decided to carry on where I left off, and signed up for a software development program using Java, which was a brand new language 
when I first starting learning it :-). I have since started expanding into additional languages and some web programming and am loving it.

- I'm particularly interested in development of finance tools to make personal investing easier and more transparent. I take a value approach
to investing and want to have a better toolkit for evaluating the fundamentals, a way to reduce some of the grunt work. 
- I'm also generally interested in the idea of "automating the boring stuff" in my life. Much like anyone reading this, I'm sure, I'm more
interested in my projects than I am the monotony of daily life. I always love to hear about projects to automate some of that away. 

I work primarily with Java ... I'm starting to work with python, and javascript.
