Hi,

I have been writing snippets of code for most of my adult life for work and personal projects. I took some programming in university, but a lot has changed since then. In March of 2020
I decided to carry on where I left off, and signed up for a software development certificate program using Java and SQL. I really wanted to take my understanding of programming to the next level, including getting deeper into
OOP. I have since started expanding into additional languages and some web programming and am loving it.

These days, I work primarily with JavaScript, and React, and have been experimenting with NextJS, NextAuth, Prisma, and Tailwind.

My website is really a space to experiment with new tools and practice new techniques. It is rarely in any kind of polished shape and has been redeveloped and redeployed countless times. 

- I'm particularly interested in development of finance tools to make personal investing easier and more transparent. I take a value approach
to investing and want to have a better toolkit for evaluating the fundamentals, a way to reduce some of the grunt work.
- Having worked most of my professional career in Engineering and Project Management roles, I am always curious about adding new tools to automate
repetitive tasks and to solve complex problems in a transparent and replicable fashion.   
- I'm generally interested in the idea of "automating the boring stuff" in my life. My current pet project is creating a database of easy to prep
meals with a menu planner ui to make that process a little easier. Does anyone else ever feel like the more effort you put into supper, the less
your kids enjoy it? If I had an extra £248,000 I suppose I could just buy a kitchen bot ...
